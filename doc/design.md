# Language Design Notes

First of all, here are the [specs of the previous Romualdo
iteration](https://github.com/lmbarros/romualdo-language/blob/master/doc/maybe-the-ideal-grammar.md).

For this iteration, the main changes are:

* The output from Romualdo to the host program is text only. At least initially.
  And, of course this text could be structured and interpreted by the host in
  various ways -- but from Romualdo's perspective, it's just text.
* Outputting text is much simpler. Basically, within a `passage` things are
  scanned differently: everything is text that will be output. Programming
  constructs are still possible, but keywords must be prefixed by a backslash
  (`\`).

## Passages

Tentative example:

```romualdo
passage thePassage(): void

    This is text that is outputted when running the passage. The common
    indentation shared by all lines is removed.

    \if whatever then
        And this is outputted conditionally. BTW, backlashed keywords are always
        valid, but we may not need them always, like shown here. We *know* that
        an expression and then `then` must come after `\if`. Now, maybe a bad
        idea but an `end` with less indentation can be interpreted as an `end`
        instead of text with invalid indentation.
    end
end
```
