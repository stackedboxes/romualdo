# The Romualdo Language

*A programming language for Interactive Storytelling.*

## Status

Very not suitable for anything. Ongoing design and development. This repo is a
language redesign of a [previous, unfinished
incarnation](https://github.com/lmbarros/romualdo-language) of Romualdo.

## Credits

* The Romualdo Language syntax is in no small extent inspired by
  [Lua](http://www.lua.org).
* [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) was a considerable, too. Romualdo's
  goals are quite different (it is meant to more like a traditional programming
  language), but learning about Ink and using it a little bit lead to a large
  Romualdo redesing.
* The implementation is strongly based on Bob Nystrom's excellent [Crafting
  Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com). I cannot understate how
  this book was useful.
